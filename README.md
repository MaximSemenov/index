Hello, my name is Maxim and I am a web-developer specialized in JavaScript. I created this index as a tool to navigate through the projects I have worked on since January 2017. The index has small descriptions about my projects, a link to the GitHub repository (source), and a live (demo) version to see applications in action. Use the navigation below:


* [How to use the Index](#get-started)
* [Where are the applications are hosted](#hosting)
* [What languages and frameworks I use](#languages-and-frameworks)
* [List of my projects](#list-of-projects)
  * [Algorithmus](#algorithmus) - Angular, TypeScript, NodeJS
  * [Gmail Clone](#gmail-clone) - Angular, TypeScript, MySQL and PHP
  * [Checkers](#checkers-game) - JavaScript ES6
  * [Cheesboard](#chessboard) - Vanilla JavaScript
  * [Algorithmus](#algorithmus) - Angular, TypeScript, NodeJS
  * [Angular admin](#angular-admin) - Angular, TypeScript
  * [Calculator](#calculator) - Vanilla JavaScript

## Get Started

I have set up a user friendly navigation to help you explore my projects. Just click on any link to look into that project. Inside a project's repository there is a full descritpion that is provided to explain the purpose and the history of that application.

## Hosting

I use GitHub Pages because it is a useful tool and I like that my projects can be hosted directly from my GitHub repositories. I can edit and push, and changes are live, which is the best part. The bad side is that GitHub Pages, being free, is not that stable and it has some issues periodically.  

## Languages and Frameworks

I started learning JavaScript in 2017 from early ES3 up to ES6. Before this I had been working mostly with HTML and CSS. I am a self-taught developer who has always enjoyed learning and discovering. In my projects I use plain Javascript (vanilla JS), ES6 and WebPack, Typescript, Angular5 framework and NodeJS.

## List of projects:

### Algorithmus

Algorithmus - is a single page application build with Angular. After I began accumulating a moderate amount of solved algorithms that had become spread across my computer, I decided to collect them all and combine them in one app. I added a few features to it and it includes a Test Performance function for testing the code and an Acceptance Test for each algorithm. There is a delay when you do your first Acceptance Test to "wake up" Heroku due to a free Heroku package I used for this project.

### Gmail Clone

Gmail Clone - is an Angular adaptation of the best mail service by Google - Gmail. PHP and MySQL are used for the server side.

### Chessboard

Chessboard - is a square board that can be used for many board games that require checkered squares to play on. You can click on it to start and move the highlighted square by using keyboard arrow keys.

### Checkers game

Checkers - is a board game for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. I though it would be fun to create this game since I had already created the board and now just needed to add the funtionality of moving pieces and capturing opponents.

### Angular Admin

Angular Admin - is an adaptation of a static html template with many pages and jQuery, into a dynamic and powerful Angular single page application.

### Calculator

Calculator - is the first application I made with plain JavaScript. I haven't chosen to upgrade it because I like to have a record of the progress I've been able to make as I continue to grow and develop as a programist in JavaScript.

## VPS

I use [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
